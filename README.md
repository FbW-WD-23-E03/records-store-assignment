# Web Development Assignment: Record Shop Application

This assignment will help you practice building a full-stack application with a backend using Express.js and LowDB and a frontend with provided starter code.

## What You Will Be Doing

This project allows you to practice:

> - Setting up an Express.js server
> - Working with environment variables using `.env`
> - Implementing LowDB for a simple JSON-based database
> - Handling CORS and parsing request body data
> - Creating RESTful endpoints for a record shop application
> - Modifying and connecting provided frontend code with your backend

## Backend Tasks

### Task 1 - Initialize the Backend Project

- In the `server` folder, initialize a Node.js project and install necessary dependencies.

### Task 2 - Set Up the Express Server

- Create an Express server.
- Use a `.env` file to store the PORT variable.

### Task 3 - Set Up LowDB

- Initialize a LowDB database named `records.json`.

### Task 4 - Create Endpoints

- Implement a `GET /getRecords` endpoint to retrieve records.
- Implement a `POST /addRecord` endpoint to add new records.

### Task 5 - Handle CORS and Request Body

- Set up middleware to handle CORS.
- Parse incoming request body data.

### Task 6 - Data Handling

- Store incoming data in `records.json`.
- Send request data back to the client as a response.

## Frontend Tasks

### Modify the Provided Frontend Code

- Use the provided frontend code.
- Modify the functions to connect with your backend endpoints.

## Reflection and Documentation Task:

#### Write a short summary explaining:

> Use the provided file `report.README.md` for this task

- How the Express server handles requests and responses.
- The role of LowDB in this project.
- Challenges faced and how you resolved them
